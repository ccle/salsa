        <li>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without the express written permission by USU.</li>
        <li>We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of Service.</li>
        <li>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may be transfered unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</li>
        <li>You must not upload, post, host, or transmit unsolicited email, SMSs, or "spam" messages.</li>

        <li>If your bandwidth usage significantly exceeds the average bandwidth usage (as determined solely by USU) of other USU customers, we reserve the right to immediately disable your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</li>
        <li>USU does not warrant that (i) the service will meet your specific requirements, (ii) the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable, (iv) the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the service will meet your expectations, and (v) any errors in the Service will be corrected.</li>
